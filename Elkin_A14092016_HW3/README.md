Limitations - My limitations on this assignment come from my prior lack of knowledge of working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and HighCharts. I often found myself filling up an entire browser with 50+ tabs looking up specific tags and features in the HighCharts Library. I found this homework assignment to be VERY challenging and spent upwards of 20+ hours learning HighCharts/JavaScript and creating my dashboard. Despite this, I ended up vastly expanding my knowledge of JavaScript (DOM), HTML, CSS, and HighCharts. I can confidently say that I would be able to make various graphs, legends, and charts in HighCharts. I unfortunately was not able to complete the toggle option on the pie chart to switch between the pie and bar chart. Additionally, there are a few features missing from the Legend.  




Sources - I used the ZingCharts solution shown in discussion, StackOverflow for various problems, the HighCharts API found here (https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/), and the synchronized charts examples found on Jsfiddel - mainly this one (https://www.highcharts.com/demo/synchronized-charts).
